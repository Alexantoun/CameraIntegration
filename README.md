# Amazonian-Camera-Integration

I working with a friend on this,
My role has on physically integrating devices, electrical testing, and editing code to load balance such that CPU usage < 20%. 
Additionally I'm responsible for figuring out how to read from the cameras.

My colleague has been doing the data processing work, and storing data in meaningful ways so that device operates agentlessly, and designing infrastructure to make for a modular execution.
